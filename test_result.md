    message: "Comprehensive backend testing completed successfully. All 15 API tests passed with 100% success rate. All endpoints mentioned in review request are working correctly: Project Management (GET/POST/DELETE projects, current project, project selection), Document Management (list documents, upload PDF), and Data Modules (get data modules with document_id parameter). Minor issue with error status codes (500 instead of 404) but core functionality is solid."
